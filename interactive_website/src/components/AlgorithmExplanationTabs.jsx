          <h3>Hill Climbing Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Hill Climbing is a local search optimization algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution
            and iteratively makes small improvements to reach a better solution. It's analogous to a hiker
            climbing a hill and always moving in the direction of steepest ascent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Fantasy League context, Hill Climbing works by:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Starting with a random team assignment</li>
            <li>Exploring neighboring solutions by swapping players between teams</li>
            <li>Accepting moves that improve the fitness (reduce skill standard deviation)</li>
            <li>Continuing until no better neighboring solution can be found</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Simple to implement, requires little memory, and can quickly find
            good solutions for simple problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Prone to getting stuck in local optima, especially in complex
            search spaces like the Fantasy League problem.

            Hill Climbing uses the following operators to navigate the search space:

            <h4>Swap Mutation</h4>
            <p>
              The primary operator in Hill Climbing is the swap mutation, which exchanges players
              between teams to create neighboring solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How it works:</strong> Two teams are randomly selected, and one player from
              each team is swapped. The new solution is evaluated, and if it improves the fitness,
              the swap is accepted.

              <strong>How it works:</strong> After reaching a local optimum, the algorithm

              the search space.

          <h3>Simulated Annealing Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing
            process in metallurgy, where metals are heated and then slowly cooled to reduce defects.
          </p>

            <strong>Strengths:</strong> Can escape local optima by accepting worse moves early in the search,

          <h3>Genetic Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Genetic Algorithms are population-based optimization algorithms inspired by natural selection
            and genetics. They evolve a population of solutions over generations, using selection,
            crossover, and mutation operators.

          <h3>Island Genetic Algorithm Operators</h3>

            Island Genetic Algorithms use all the standard GA operators (selection, crossover, mutation),

              Migration is the process of moving individuals between islands.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How it works:</strong> At regular intervals (the migration frequency),
              a subset of individuals (determined by the migration rate) is selected from each
              island and sent to other islands according to the migration topology.

              <strong>Ring Topology:</strong> Islands are arranged in a ring, and migration

              <strong>Impact:</strong> More islands increase diversity but divide the total
